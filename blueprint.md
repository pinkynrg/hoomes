# 🏡 Hoomes: Your Gateway to Italian Real Estate 🏡

Welcome to **Hoomes**, a tool for scraping and searching homes for sale in Italy. Hoomes helps users find properties by gathering data from leading real estate platforms like [Idealista](https://www.idealista.it/) and [Caaasa.it](https://www.caasa.it/). What sets Hoomes apart is its ability to search within property comments, giving you deeper insights into listings. Whether you're browsing or searching for something specific, Hoomes provides the information you need to make informed decisions.

## 🌟 What Hoomes Does

Hoomes pulls listings from popular Italian real estate platforms and allows you to perform powerful full-text searches across the descriptions of each scraped property. Imagine being able to search for keywords like "panoramic view," "garden," or "historical center" across thousands of listings in seconds!

When you make a request, Hoomes scrapes the data on-demand, so it may take a bit of time to fetch the initial data. However, once the data is retrieved, it’s saved into your browser's IndexedDB, enabling faster searches without the need to re-fetch data. This approach reduces server load and ensures a smoother experience. Additionally, a backend SQLite database is used to cache results, further optimizing performance and reducing delays in subsequent searches.
